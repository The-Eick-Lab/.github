### About Us
---
Welcome to the Eick Lab at [Emory University](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=stephanie-eick-12810)! Working jointly in Environmental Health and Epidemiology, we research the effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors through reproductive epidemiology, particulary during pregnancy and in early childhood. Here, we share the code and documentation of our team's projects.
