### About Us
---
Welcome to the Research on the Environment and Pediatric and Reproductive Outcomes (REPRO) lab at [Emory University](https://sph.emory.edu/)  led by [Stephanie Eick, PhD](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=stephanie-eick-12810)! We are working jointly in Environmental Health and Epidemiology to research the effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors on perinatal and early childhood outcomes, focusing particulary on exposures occuring during pregnancy. Here, we share the code and documentation of our team's projects. More info about our research group is found [here](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/repro/).
